                <h2>B.B.A</h2>
                <p>BBA is a 4 years full-time study in one or more areas of business concentrations.The degree is
                    designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional aspects of a company and their
                    interconnection, while also allowing specialization in a particular area. BBA programs thus expose
                    students to a variety of "core subjects" and generally allow students to specialize in a specific
                    academic area.To learn more about the program <a href="http://www.aayaamcollege.edu.np/">click here</a>.</p>
